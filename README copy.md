# **Do It or Else!** 
*Light a fire under To Do Lists with motivational self-Blackmail*


Do it or Else! is a tool created to foster user follow-through on tasks. 
Born from a novel and evidence-based idea of upping self-productivity by way of avoiding embarrassment, this app holds you to your personally-created To Do queues by firing off one of your previously-entered embarrassing actions unless the task is completed by its deadline. 

To Do Lists, activity reminders, and calendar notes that remain unfinished and undone are commonplace in most of our daily lives. Their mere presence around us can often invoke our feelings of guilt, avoidance, and general self-negativity, superceding their original purpose of encouraging us toward taking an action necessary to complete, and cross off, the task at hand. 

The Do it or Else! self-Blackmail technique revokes the traditional To Do List and replaces it with a more effective, and more entertaining, self-propelled motivational tool to help you just get that sh*t done!

**Scientific basis: 
"Negative reinforcement is a term described by B. F. Skinner in his theory of operant conditioning. In negative reinforcement, a response or behavior is strengthened by stopping, removing, or avoiding a negative outcome or aversive stimulus,"

## Tech

Do It or Else! is a full-stack CRUD application utilizing a combination of four technologies — MongoDB(M), Express(E), React(R), NodeJS(N):
       
🌐 The MERN Stack

This stack's Client-Server architecture uses Express and Mongoose ODM within a React.js project structure to enable front-end functionality capable of making HTTP Requests/consuming Responses:
        
        >Client:
            React! - JS library for building U/I,
            MongoDB - App data platform,
            Axios - Promise-based HTTP client for Browser/Node.js
                                            `(insert links in all these)`
        >Server:
            Node.js - I/O for backend, 
            Express.js - Unopinionated web framework for Node.js,
            Mongoose - mongoose
                                            `(insert links in all these)`

    *for more details, see package.json on both Client and Server sides*


## Installation

To get started: 

Install dependencies with:

yarn

Start the development environment:

yarn start
First you'll need Node.js and the package manager that comes with it: npm.

Once you've got that working, head to the command line where we'll set up our project.

Clone the Tutorial
git clone https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial
cd react-router-tutorial
cd lessons/01-setting-up
npm install
npm start
Now open up http://localhost:8080

Feel free to poke around the code to see how we're using webpack and npm scripts to run the app.

You should see a "Hello React Router" message in the browser.
